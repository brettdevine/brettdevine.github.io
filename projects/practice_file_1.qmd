A practice document using the "USArrests" data.

So here is where I'd have lots of things to say and such. So this is where we add text, lets *emphasize* that if we are not too **bold**.

```{r}
data(USArrests)
```

We could also look at how the scatter plots above are showing the correlation coefficient.
$$
\begin{align}
    \rho(X,Y) = \frac{Cov(X,Y)}{Var(X)\cdot V(Y)}
\end{align}
$$

And the cool thing is, the math worked out quite well

```{r}
plot(USArrests)
```
